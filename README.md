ADFBRequestDialogViewController
===============================

UIViewController with FBDialog to send Facebook app request inside.

In API 2.0 Facebook changed *me/friends* endpoint, so according changelog
```objective-c
Friend list now only returns friends who also use your app:\nThe list of friends returned via the /me/friends endpoint is now \nlimited to the list of friends that have authorized your app.
```
